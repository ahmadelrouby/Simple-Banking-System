# Simple-Banking-System

This is a simple banking system application. With both the frontend and the backend of the application ready, all you need is to replace the asterisks in Twilio API KEY and email as well as do an npm install on the backend and the frontend to be ready to go.

The application was built as a project for the database project at the American University in Cairo. It allows the existence of three types of users: Admins, Clients and Tellers.

Admins have the ability to add tellers, remove tellers, change their passwords as well as doing the same for other admins.

Tellers can add new clients and perform transactions for their accounts.

Clients can request an online account to view transactions and transfer money as such.
